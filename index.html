            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p>Museums house invaluable artifacts and artworks that require meticulous protection against theft, vandalism, and environmental hazards. Traditional security systems often fall short in providing comprehensive surveillance and real-time monitoring. To address these challenges, an IoT-based museum security system is proposed, leveraging interconnected sensors, cameras, and smart devices.
                This project aims to design and implement a sophisticated security infrastructure using IoT technology to fortify museum premises. The system integrates sensors such as motion detector and ultrasonic sensor strategically positioned throughout the museum. These sensors form a network interconnected via a central hub, enabling real-time data collection and analysis.
                The system will detect anomalies in the museum environment, triggering immediate alerts to security personnel or administrators
                In conclusion, this IoT-based museum security system offers a robust and intelligent solution to safeguard priceless artifacts, enhance surveillance capabilities within the museum premises. Its implementation promises to elevate the standards of museum security, ensuring the protection and preservation of cultural treasures for future generations.
